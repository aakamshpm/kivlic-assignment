This react application was developed based on the XD design of Kivlic Career. 
The website is completly static.
It is responsive in every devices and is user friendly. The whole code follows a neat structure which makes updating the website easier.
All the images used are available inside assets folder.

The assignment was fascinating to do and helped me improve on my react files & folder structuring and css skills as well.
